/*
NOTE:
Sets are like an array but with no duplicate items and the values are not in any particular order.
Functions common in sets - has, values, add, remove, size, 
union - combine sets and remove duplicates, intersection - returns the intersection as a new set, 
difference -  returns  items in one set, not in the other, subset - test if the first set is a subset of the other set.
